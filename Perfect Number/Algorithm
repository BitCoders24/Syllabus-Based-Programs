1. Import the java.util package.
2. Define a class named "Perfect".
3. Declare an instance variable "n" of type integer.
4. Define a constructor "Perfect(int num)" that takes an integer parameter "num" and assigns its value to the instance variable "n".
5. Define a method "sum_of_fact(int num)" that takes an integer parameter "num" and calculates the sum of factors of "num".
    a. Declare a variable "sum" and initialize it to 0. This variable will store the sum of factors.
    b. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to "num-1".
    c. Inside the loop, check if "num" is divisible by the current loop variable "i" without a remainder.
    d. If it is divisible, add "i" to the "sum".
    e. After the loop, return the "sum".
6. Define a method "check()" that checks if the number "n" is a perfect number.
    a. Call the "sum_of_fact()" method with "n" as the parameter and store the result in a variable "t".
    b. Compare "n" with "t".
    c. If they are equal, print "Perfect Number".
    d. Otherwise, print "Not Perfect Number".
7. Define the main method "main()".
    a. Create a new Scanner object "sc" to read input from the user.
    b. Print "Enter the number to be checked : " to prompt the user.
    c. Read an integer from the user and assign it to the variable "p" using "sc.nextInt()".
    d. Create an instance of the "Perfect" class called "obj" with the value of "p" as the constructor parameter.
    e. Call the "check()" method on the "obj" object.
8. End of the program.
