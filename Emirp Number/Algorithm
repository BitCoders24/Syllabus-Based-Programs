1. Import the java.util package.
2. Define a class named "emirp".
3. Declare an instance variable "n" of type integer.
4. Define a constructor "emirp(int nn)" that takes an integer parameter "nn" and assigns its value to the instance variable "n".
5. Define a method "isprime(int m)" that takes an integer parameter "m" and checks if it is a prime number.
    a. Declare a variable "c" and initialize it to 0. This variable will count the number of factors of "m".
    b. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to "m".
    c. Inside the loop, check if "m" is divisible by the current loop variable "i" without a remainder.
    d. If it is divisible, increment "c" by 1.
    e. After the loop, check if "c" is equal to 2.
    f. If it is, return 1 (indicating that "m" is a prime number), otherwise return 2.
6. Define a method "reverse(int num)" that takes an integer parameter "num" and reverses its digits.
    a. Declare a variable "r" and initialize it to 0. This variable will store the reversed number.
    b. Use a for loop to iterate while "num" is greater than 0.
    c. Inside the loop, extract the last digit of "num" using the modulus operator and store it in a variable "d".
    d. Multiply "r" by 10 and add "d" to it, to update the reversed number.
    e. Divide "num" by 10 to remove the last digit.
    f. Repeat steps c to e until "num" becomes 0.
    g. Return the reversed number "r".
7. Define a method "check()" that checks if the number "n" is an emirp number.
    a. Use the "isprime()" method to check if "n" is a prime number, and also use the "reverse()" method to check if the reversed number of "n" is a prime number.
    b. If both conditions are true, print "It is an emirp number".
    c. Otherwise, print "It is not an emirp number".
8. Define the main method "main(String[] args)".
    a. Create a new Scanner object "sc" to read input from the user.
    b. Print "Enter a number" to prompt the user.
    c. Read an integer from the user and assign it to the variable "a" using "sc.nextInt()".
    d. Create an instance of the "emirp" class called "ob" with the value of "a" as the constructor parameter.
    e. Call the "check()" method on the "ob" object.
9. End of the program.
