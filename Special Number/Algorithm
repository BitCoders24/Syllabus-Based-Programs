1. Import the java.util package.
2. Define a class named "Special_Number".
3. Declare an instance variable "n" of type integer.
4. Define a constructor "Special_Number(int nn)" that takes an integer parameter "nn" and assigns its value to the instance variable "n".
5. Define a method "fact(int a)" that calculates the factorial of a number.
    a. Declare a variable "f" and initialize it to 1. This variable will store the factorial.
    b. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to "a".
    c. Inside the loop, multiply "f" by the current loop variable "i".
    d. After the loop, return the factorial "f".
6. Define a method "sumofdigits(int m)" that calculates the sum of the factorials of the digits of a number.
    a. Declare a variable "s" and initialize it to 0. This variable will store the sum of factorials.
    b. Use a for loop to iterate while "m" is greater than 0.
    c. Inside the loop, extract the last digit of "m" using the modulus operator and store it in a variable "d".
    d. Call the "fact()" method with "d" as the parameter to calculate the factorial of "d", and add it to "s".
    e. Divide "m" by 10 to remove the last digit.
    f. Repeat steps c to e until "m" becomes 0.
    g. Return the sum of factorials "s".
7. Define a method "check()" that checks if the number "n" is a special number.
    a. Call the "sumofdigits()" method with "n" as the parameter and compare it with "n".
    b. If they are equal, print "Special Number".
    c. Otherwise, print "Not a Special Number".
8. Define the main method "main(String[] args)".
    a. Create a new Scanner object "sc" to read input from the user.
    b. Print "Enter a number" to prompt the user.
    c. Read an integer from the user and assign it to the variable "x" using "sc.nextInt()".
    d. Create an instance of the "Special_Number" class called "ob" with the value of "x" as the constructor parameter.
    e. Call the "check()" method on the "ob" object.
9. End of the program.
