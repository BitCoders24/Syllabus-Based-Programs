1. Start the program.
2. Declare a class named "Armstrong".
3. Inside the class, declare an integer variable "n" to store the input number.
4. Define a constructor for the class that takes an integer parameter "nn" and assigns it to the "n" variable.
5. Define a method named "sumofdigits" that takes an integer parameter "m" and returns an integer.
6. Inside the method, declare an integer variable "s" and initialize it to 0.
7. Use a loop to iterate through the digits of the number "m" from right to left:
   a. Initialize a loop variable "i" with the value of "m".
   b. Iterate until "i" becomes 0.
   c. In each iteration, extract the last digit of "i" by calculating "d = i % 10".
   d. Add the cube of the extracted digit to the sum "s" using the expression "s = s + (int)Math.pow(d, 3)".
   e. Update the value of "i" by dividing it by 10.
8. Return the value of "s" as the sum of the digits.
9. Define a method named "check" that has no parameters and returns void.
10. Inside the method, check if the sum of digits of "n" is equal to "n":
    a. If true, print "its an armstrong number".
    b. If false, print "its not an armstrong number".
11. Define the main method.
12. Create a Scanner object named "sc" to read input from the user.
13. Print "enter a number" to prompt the user for input.
14. Read an integer from the user and store it in the variable "l" using "sc.nextInt()".
15. Create an object "obj" of the "Armstrong" class, passing "l" as the parameter to the constructor.
16. Call the "check" method on the "obj" object.
17. End the program.
